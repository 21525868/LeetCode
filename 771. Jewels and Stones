You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 Constraints:
1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

Solution: /**
 * @param {string} jewels
 * @param {string} stones
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    var sum=0;
    if(jewels.length>=1 && jewels.length<=50){
for(var i=0;i<=jewels.length-1;i++){
    if (jewels.indexOf(jewels[i]) !== jewels.lastIndexOf(jewels[i])){
    continue;
    }
    for(var j=0;j<=stones.length-1;j++){
        if(jewels[i]==stones[j]){
             sum= sum +1;
        }} }}
   return sum;
};
